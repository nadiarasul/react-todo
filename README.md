React To Do App with Firebase


A simple to do app I created using the ReactJS framework. It builds upon Kristen Spencer's React To Do Starter App. Users can add items quickly through the input field and remove them easily by clicking the 'x' next to each item. I integrated Google's Firebase to store the list items and use the browser's local storage to store the user's name in an input field that becomes editable when you click on it.
